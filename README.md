Deep Learning (DL) models are increasingly integrated into vulnerability detection systems, and has achieved remarkable success. However, the lack of explainability poses a critical challenge to deploy black-box models in security-related domains. For this reason, several approaches have been proposed to explain the decision logic of the detection model by providing a set of crucial statements positively contributing to its predictions. Unfortunately, due to the weak robustness of DL models and failure to satisfy certain special requirements in security domains, existing explanation approaches are not directly applicable to DL-based vulnerability detection systems.

In this paper, we propose Coca, a general framework aiming to 1) enhance the robustness of existing neural vulnerability detection models to avoid spurious explanations; and 2) provide both _concise_ and _effective_ explanations to reason about the detected vulnerabilities. Coca consists of two core parts referred to as _Trainer_ and _Explainer_. The former aims to train a detection model which is robust to random perturbation based on contrastive learning, while the latter builds an explainer to derive crucial statements that are most decisive to the detected vulnerability via dual-view causal inference. We apply _Trainer_ over three types of DL-based vulnerability detectors and provide the prototype implementation of _Explainer_ for GNN-based models. Experimental results show that Coca can effectively improve existing DL-based vulnerability detection systems, and provide high-quality explanations.
